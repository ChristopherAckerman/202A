\end{abstract}
\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\item In this economy, assume that $r = \delta$. Prove Hallâ€™s Corollary 1 and 2, and 4. In addition, how would you go about estimating the implied regression in Corrolary 4?
Solving the constrained maximization problem we have the following
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L} = E_t \sum_{\tau=0}^{T-\tau} \frac{u(c_{t+\tau})}{(1+\delta)^\tau} + \lambda \left(\sum_{\tau=0}^{T-\tau} \frac{c_{t+\tau}}{(1+r)^\tau} - \sum_{\tau=0}^{T-\tau}\frac{w_{t+\tau}}{(1+r)^\tau} - A_t \right)
\end{align*}

The FOC with respect to $c_{t+\tau}$ is then given by
\begin{align*}
    [c_{t+\tau}]: \quad  E_t \frac{u'(c_{t+\tau})}{(1+\delta)^\tau} + \lambda \frac{1}{(1+r)^\tau} = 0
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    \tau = 0 & \Rightarrow E_t [u'(c_t)] = u'(c_t) = -\lambda\\
    \tau = 1 & \Rightarrow E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] = - \lambda \frac{1+\delta}{1+r}
\end{align*}

From this two conditions we get
\begin{align*}
    E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] =  \frac{1+\delta}{1+r} u'(c_t)
\end{align*}

\begin{corollary}[Corollary 1 from Hall's paper]
No information available in period $t$ apart from the level of consumption, $c_t$, helps predict future consumption, $c_{t+1}$, in the sense of affecting the expected value of marginal utility. In particular, income or wealth in periods $t$ or earlier are irrelevant, once $c_t$ is known. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Once we obtain the equation above, we can conclude that both income or wealth do not predict the future level of consumption in the sense of affecting the expected value of marginal utility. Moreover, considering the case where $r=\delta$, we get
\begin{align*}
    E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] =   u'(c_t)
\end{align*}
which means that there are no other factors expect current level of consumption that affect the future consumption (assuming that we have time separable utility function, depending on consumption only).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Corollary 2 from Hall's paper]
Marginal utility obeys the regression relation, $u'(c_{t+1}) = \gamma u'(c_t) + \varepsilon_{t+1}$, where $\gamma = (1+\delta)/(1+r)$ and $\varepsilon_{t+1}$ is a true regression disturbance; that is, $E_t [\varepsilon_{t+1}] = 0$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Taking the conditional expectation at period t we get
\begin{align*}
     E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] =  \gamma E_t [u'(c_t)] + E_t[\varepsilon_{t+1}]
\end{align*}
Since the consumption at period $t$ is known, $E_t [u'(c_t)] = u'(c_t)$. The relation from constrained maximization problem is that $E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] =  (1+\delta)/(1+r) u'(c_t)$. Then, indeed, the marginal utility can be expressed as the above stated regression relation with $\gamma = (1+\delta)/(1+r)$ and $E_t[\varepsilon_{t+1}] = E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] -  \gamma E_t [u'(c_t)] = E_t [u'(c_{t+1})] - (1+\delta)/(1+r) u'(c_t)=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Corollary 4 from Hall's paper]
If the utility function has the constant elasticity of substitution form, $u(c_t) = c_t^{(\sigma-1)/\sigma}$, then the following statistical model describes the evolution of consumption: $c_{t+1}^{-1/\sigma} = \gamma c_t^{-1/\sigma} + \varepsilon_{t+1}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
From Corollary 2 we have that the marginal utility of consumption can be represented as the following regression relation
\begin{align*}
    u'(c_{t+1}) = \gamma u'(c_t) + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
Calculating the marginal utility for the constant elasticity of substitution utility form we get
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma} c_{t+1}^{-1/\sigma} = \gamma \frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma} c_t^{-1/\sigma} + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
Since $(\sigma-1)/\sigma$ is a constant, we can rewrite this regression as follows (without loss of generality)
\begin{align*}
    c_{t+1}^{-1/\sigma} = \gamma c_t^{-1/\sigma} + \varepsilon_{t+1}^*
\end{align*}
where $\varepsilon_{t+1}^* = \sigma/(\sigma-1) \varepsilon_{t+1}$, and therefore, $E_t[\varepsilon_{t+1}^*] = E_t[\sigma/(\sigma-1) \varepsilon_{t+1}] = \sigma/(\sigma-1) E_t[\varepsilon_{t+1}] = 0$.
\end{proof}

For estimating this regression we propose the log transformation
\begin{align*}
    \ln c_{t+1} = \mu + \gamma \ln c_t + \epsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
Then we can apply OLS method to estimate this regression, which is asymptotically equivalent to MLE estimator. In this case, the coefficient will be interpreted as a $\gamma$-percentage increase in future consumption in response to a 1-percentage increase in the current consumption.

\newpage
\item Explain the economic intuition for why the stochastic process for income is irrelevant in terms of being able to forecast future consumption. 

Considering stochastic process for income implies that the deviations from some stationary level are unexpected, thus they do not affect consumption (and are actually disturbance). All the expected deviations (change of trend) are incorporated in current consumption, and do not have any additional information that can help predict the future consumption.

\newpage
\item Explain the economic intuition why if $r < \delta$, then consumption evolves as a random walk with positive drift, in which there is a constant term in the regression that is negative. 

Having that marginal utility obeys a random walk apart from the trend, we can consider small deviations from the steady state consumption and expand the implicit equation for $c_{t+1}$ and $c_t$ in a Taylor series.
\begin{align*}
   E_t [u'(\Bar{c}) + u''(\Bar{c})(c_{t+1}-\Bar{c})] = \frac{1+\delta}{1+r} [u'(\Bar{c}) + u''(\Bar{c})(c_{t}-\Bar{c})]\\
\end{align*}
which can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
    c_{t+1} = \left(\frac{1+\delta}{1+r} -1 \right) \left(\frac{u'(\Bar{c})}{u''(\Bar{c})}-\Bar{c}\right) + \frac{1+\delta}{1+r} c_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
Since $r<\delta$, we conclude that $(1+\delta)/(1+r)-1>0$. Also, we know that by assumption made in Hall's paper utility function is strictly concave, thus $u''(\Bar{c}) <0$ and $u'(\Bar{c})/u''(\Bar{c})-\Bar{c}<0$. Hence, this regression can be rewritten as follows
\begin{align*}
    c_{t+1} = \mu + \gamma c_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
which is a random walk with a positive drift $\gamma$ and negative constant $\mu$.

Intuitively, this result can be obtained from the fact that under the permanent income hypothesis individual chooses current consumption by estimating the future ability to consume. Thus, any information and changes in income at time $t$ are unexpected, and make changes in future consumption unpredictable. Also, since the interest rate is lower than the rate of subjective time preference, individuals prefer to consume now, and future consumption responds more than 1 for 1 to a change in current consumption.

\newpage
\item  Obtain quarterly real consumption (in chained dollars) from the U.S.
national income and product accounts from 1950 through 2019. Fit the following
regression:
\[
\ln(c_t) = \mu + \lambda \ln(c_{t-1}) + u_t
\]

\item  Do you think that this is a reasonable statistical model of the log of
consumption? (Your answer to this question may include a discussion regarding
the value of the autoregressive coefficient, the R-square, and whether there is
autocorrelation in the $u_t$ residuals.)

\end{figure}

The model fits reasonably well. Firstly, the value of the value of the autoregressive coefficient in listing \ref{lst:data-output} (i.e the code output) is highly significant (with a p-value near 0 even), along with strong significance in the constant and variance. The R squared is \( 0.999857 \) (with the adjusted R being very similar since we are only estimating one lag) suggesting that the model explains the data very well. We also do a rudimentary test to see if the error is white noise in listing \ref{lst:resid-output} which shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the 5\% significance that residuals have an AR(1) structure.

In figure \ref{fig:q4-data-autocorrplot} we see that the data clearly has a lagged structure. It is to be expected that with an AR(1) with a value for \( \rho \) close to 1, the lagged effects of the shock should be persistent. That is, we should {\itshape expect} non-zero auto correlation at all lags, which is in contrast to, say, an MA(q) process which only has non-zero autocorrelation for the first \( q \) lags. 

The autocorrelations of the residual of the above model are plotted in figure \ref{fig:q4-residual-autocorrplot}. This figure shows that most of the lags are within the confidence intervals around 0 and hence looks reasonably like white noise.

To verify our intuitions, we simulate an AR model with the same sample moments as the data in figures \ref{fig:q4-data-simulated-autocorrplot} and \ref{fig:q4-residual-simulated-autocorrplot}. Both confirm our findings that the data fits an AR(1) reasonably well.

There are some minor discrepancies when considering the Box-Ljuyng test that are persistent even with more lags. Despite that, we still believe that given the evidence that an AR(1) for consumption is a {\itshape reasonable} model.

Next, consider the following economy.
\begin{align*}
\max & E_0 \sum^\infty_{t = 0}\beta^t \ln (c_t)\\
\intertext{subject to}
z_t A_t^{1 - \theta} k_t^\theta + (1 - \delta)k_t &= c_t + k_{t + 1}\\
A_t &= (1 + \gamma)^t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots \\
\ln(z_t) &= \rho \ln (z_{t - 1}) + \varepsilon_t,\quad \varepsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)
\end{align*}

Assume that the time period is annual. Construct a detrended version of
this economy and show the first order conditions. Choose $\beta$ so that the return
to capital in the steady state of the detrended economy is five percent, choose
$\theta$ so that capitalâ€™s share of income is 30 percent, and choose a depreciation rate
such that the share of investment to GDP in the steady state is 20 percent.
Choose $\rho = 0.95$, $\sigma^2_\varepsilon
 = .002$ and $\gamma = 0.02$.

\begin{align*}
\intertext{Rearranging terms, we have}
k_{t + 1} &= A_t^{1 - \theta} k_t^\theta + (1 - \delta) k_t - c_t\\
Y_t &= A_t^{1 - \theta} k_t^\theta\\
c_t &= (1 - \theta) A_t^{1 - \theta} k_t^\theta\\
\intertext{To detrend, divide by $A_t$. Let's define a few new variables,}
\hat{k}_t &= \frac{k_t}{A_t}\\
\hat{y}_t &= \frac{y_t}{A_t}\\
\hat{c}_t &= \frac{c_t}{A_t}.\\
\intertext{Now, we can substitute these back into the original equations.}
A \hat{k}_{t + 1} &= \hat{y}_t + (1 - \delta) \hat{k}_t - \hat{c}_t\\
(1 + \gamma) \hat{k}_{t + 1} &= \hat{y}_t + (1 - \delta) \hat{k}_t - \hat{c}_t\\
\hat{y}_t &= k^\theta\\
\hat{c}_t &= (1 - \theta) \hat{y}_t.\\
\intertext{First order conditions give us}
\frac{1}{\hat{c}_t} &= \frac{\beta}{1 + \gamma} E_t \left\{\frac{1}{\hat{c}_{t + 1}}\left[\frac{\theta \hat{y}_{t + 1}}{\hat{k}_{t + 1}} + 1 - \delta \right]\right\}.\\
\intertext{In the steady state, we have}
\frac{\overline{c}}{\overline{y}} &= \frac{1 + \gamma - \beta(1 - \delta) - \theta \beta (1 + \gamma - 1 + \delta)}{1 + \gamma - \beta (1 - \delta)}.\tag{$\ast$}\label{consumption-share}\\
\intertext{Now let's solve for parameters. We're given $\gamma = 0.02$, and we have to figure out $\beta$, $\theta$ and $\delta$. Since we have Cobb Douglas production, $\theta = 0.3$. To solve for $\beta$, note that the 5\% return implies}
\beta &= \frac{1}{1.05}\\
&= 0.95238.\\
\intertext{To solve for $\delta$, we're going to use equation \ref{consumption-share}. We're told that investment in the steady state is 20\% of GDP, so that implies that consumption is 80\% of GDP,}
0.8 &= \frac{1.02 - 0.95238(1 - \delta) - 0.3 \cdot 0.95238 (1.02 - 1 + \delta)}{1.02 - 0.95238 (1 - \delta)}\\
\implies \delta &= .082.

\item 
 Log-linearize this model around its deterministic steady state. (For simplicity, assume that $z$ in the steady state is 1).

\begin{align*}
\text{Define } \tilde{x} &\equiv \log\left(\frac{\hat{x}}{\overline{x}}\right).\\
\intertext{From the Euler equation, we have}
\frac{\hat{c}_{t + 1}}{\hat{c}_t} &= \frac{\beta}{A} E_t [\theta z_{t + 1}\hat{k}^{\theta - 1}_{t + 1} + 1 - \delta].\\
\intertext{Substituting our log linearization into the left-hand side, we have}\\
\frac{\overline{c}\exp(\tilde{c}_{t + 1})}{\overline{c} \exp (\tilde{c}_t)} &\approx (1 + \tilde{c}_{t + 1})(1 - \tilde{c}_t)\tag{LHS}\\
&\approx 1 + \tilde{c}_{t + 1} - \tilde{c}_t \tag{LHS}.\\
\intertext{Doing the same thing on the right-hand side, we have}
\frac{\beta}{A} E_t [\theta \overline{z} (1 + \tilde{z}_{t + 1})\overline{k}(1 + (\theta - 1)\tilde{k}_{t + 1}) + 1 - \delta] &=
\frac{\beta}{A} E_t [\theta \overline{z} \overline{k}^{\theta - 1}(\theta - 1)\tilde{k}_{t + 1} + \theta \overline{z} \overline{k}^{\theta - 1}\tilde{z}_{t + 1} + 1 - \delta]\\
\intertext{In the steady state,}
1 &= \frac{\beta}{A}(\theta \overline{z} \overline{k}^{\theta - 1} + 1 - \delta),\\
\overline{z} &= 1.\\
\intertext{We can use these to simplify the log-linearized Euler equation:} 
\tilde{c}_{t + 1} - \tilde{c}_t &= \frac{\beta}{A} E_t [\theta \overline{k}^{\theta - 1}(\theta - 1)\tilde{k}_{t + 1} + \theta \overline{k}^{\theta - 1} \tilde{z}_{t + 1}].\\
\intertext{Now, let's do the same thing to the budget constraint.}
\hat{c}_t + A\hat{k}_{t + 1} &= z_t \hat{k}_t^\theta + (1 - \delta)\hat{k}_t \\
\overline{c}(1 + \tilde{c}_t) + A \overline{k} (1 + \hat{k}_{t + 1}) &= \overline{c} + A\overline{k} + \overline{c}\tilde{c}_t + A\overline{k}\tilde{k}_{t + 1}\tag{LHS}\\
\overline{z}(1 + \tilde{z}_t)\overline{k}^\theta (1 + \theta \tilde{k}_t) + (1 - \delta)\overline{k}(1 + \tilde{k}_t) &=
\overline{z} \overline{k}^\theta + \overline{z} \overline{k}^\theta \theta \tilde{k}_t + \overline{z} \overline{k}^\theta \tilde{z}_t + (1 - \delta) \overline{k} + (1 - \delta)\overline{k} \tilde{k}_t \tag{RHS}.\\
\intertext{In the steady state,}
\overline{c} + A \overline{k} &= \overline{z}\overline{k}^\theta + (1 - \delta)\overline{k},\\
\overline{z} &=1,
\intertext{so we can simplify this expression to}
\overline{c}\tilde{c}_t + A\overline{k}\tilde{k}_{t + 1} &= \overline{k}^\theta \theta \tilde{k}_t + \overline{k}^\theta \tilde{z}_t + (1 - \delta)\overline{k}\tilde{k}_t,\\
\intertext{or}
\tilde{k}_{t + 1} &= \frac{\overline{k}^{\theta - 1}}{A} \theta \tilde{k}_t + \frac{\overline{k}^{\theta - 1}}{A} \tilde{z}_t + \frac{1 - \delta}{A}\hat{k}_t - \frac{\overline{c}}{A \overline{k}} \tilde{c}_t.\\
\intertext{Finally, for the stochastic process, }
\ln (z_t) &= \rho \ln (z_{t - 1}) + \varepsilon_t\\
\ln (\overline{z}\exp(\tilde{z}_t)) &= \rho \ln (\overline{z} \exp(\tilde{z}_{t - 1})) + \varepsilon_t\\
\ln (\overline{z}) + \tilde{z}_t &= \rho \ln (\overline{z}) + \rho \tilde{z}_{t - 1} + \varepsilon_t \\
\implies \tilde{z}_t &= \rho \tilde{z}_{t - 1},\\
\intertext{or}
\tilde{z}_{t + 1}&= \rho \tilde{z}_t.\\
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\intertext{Putting everything together, the log-linearized version of this economy is}
\tilde{c}_{t + 1} &= E_t \left\{\frac{\beta \theta \overline{k}^{\theta - 1}}{A}\left((\theta - 1)\left[\frac{\theta \overline{k}^{\theta - 1} + 1 - \delta}{A}\tilde{k}_t + \frac{\overline{k}^{\theta - 1}}{A}\tilde{z}_t - \frac{\overline{c}}{A \overline{k}} \tilde{c}_t\right] + \rho \tilde{z}_t \right) + \tilde{c}_t \right\}\\
\hat{k}_{t + 1} &= \frac{\theta \overline{k}^{\theta - 1} + 1 - \delta}{A} \hat{k}_t + \frac{\overline{k}^{\theta - 1}}{A} \tilde{z}_t - \frac{\overline{c}}{A \overline{k}}\tilde{c}_t\\
\tilde{z}_{t + 1} &= \rho \tilde{z}_t.

The regression coefficients from both our real data and our simulated data are very similar. However, there is behavior in our simulated data that doesn't match the actual data. Our answers in number 9 have correlation in the residuals that we don't see in the real data. We also fit an AR(2) to the simulated data, and the results match much more closely.
